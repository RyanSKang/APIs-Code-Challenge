## Description
The importance of creating a quiz game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript is to really help the web application be more dynamic when the user interacts with it. My motivation to create this project was to further my understanding and confidence within JavaScript. This project really forced me to navigate and manipulate the Document Object Model. I used everything we have so far in this course by incorporating HTML and CSS in order for the web application to do things behind the scene. I manipulated HTML elements, added event listeners, created timers, and stored data--all using the power of JavaScript and an application programming interface built into the browser itself. I really didnt understand APIs during class because it was really hard to follow along, but this project allowed me to dive deep into various aspects on why a web application is considered dynamic to its user. I learned to organize my work by keeping everything separated so it is not clustered. I created 2 different JS files in order to keep my work legible and organized. One contains all of my defined variables, functions, stored data, and event listeners; while the other contains all of my questions and answers in an array so it doesn'y cluster up my work. This project was by far the most difficult one so far and it was very discouraging at times, but taking things one step at a time really helped me understand that not everything is done at once. There were times where I had to stop coding and come back when my mind is fresh to really debug my issues along the way. I had to use BCS Learning Assistant far more often than usual, I created zoom and discord calls collaborating with my fellow peers, and really utilizing my time effectively to maximize my 1 on 1 tutoring session. I am still implementing the commenting part of my code because it really helps me break things apart and build my way up to the finished product. This was very stressful, but overall it was very rewarding.

## Usage


This application really forces the user to interact in order to see all the changes that happen in the background. It also gives a refresher on basic concepts within HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a more engaging way.
